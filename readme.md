## Why learning Backend from First principles?
- Learning backend from First principle elevates you from Framework Dependant Developer to True Sofwarre Enginee, the one who is not limitted by teh tech stack the person knows and just focussing on to solve teh problems in backend engineering!
- You can new languages, frameworks if you are good at this
- When you are introuduced to a new codebase, you can find patterns and  find the core logic, the routing layers, DB connnection, by filteringf out these, you can start Fixing Bugs with Confidence, This skill is acquired by Senior Engineers/Developers, but why need to wait till BEcoming Senior engineers while you can learn form Day-1.
- Faster Onboarding: When you are Strong with Fundamentals, like How API works,
- 10x faster in New Projects
- Choosing Right Tool For Right Job: usually we are bound by hte languages we know, but for different systems and requirements, the optimal Language needed might be different, By understanding core problems in Backend Engineering, we can gain ability to opt which language to use.
- Syntax Fatigue, now as you are string at Fundamentals of Backend, you just need to know the Syyntaxes of the New languages, it wont be that hard as learning a new language form scratch as you alrdy know what all things wld be there.
- More Employabale!
